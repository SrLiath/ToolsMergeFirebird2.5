# Database Merging Tools

This repository contains a set of useful tools for comparing, merging, and manipulating databases. The listed tools can assist you in combining or merging information from two different databases, especially when you need to compare tables, columns, and create data inserts into a consolidated database.

## List of Tools

1. `compararColunas.py`: A script for comparing the columns of two tables in different databases and identifying discrepancies.

2. `CompararTabelas.py`: This tool allows you to compare tables between two databases, helping you identify structural differences.

3. `CreateDatabaseDuoGen.py`: A utility for creating a new consolidated database from the data in two separate databases.

4. `CreateDatabaseGen.py`: A script for creating a new database schema based on specific requirements.

5. `createInserts.py`: A script to generate SQL inserts for migrating data from one database to another.

6. `EspecificarTabelas.py`: A tool for specifying the tables and their relationships in a database.

## Getting Started

To use these tools, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can run each script with Python, and they may require specific database connections or configurations, depending on your use case.

Please refer to the individual script's documentation and comments for more detailed instructions on how to use them effectively.
